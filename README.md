## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if the `input` field is empty

### Features

- The user can view the optimal layout for the page for most used widths (more details below)
- The user can shorten any valid URL to https://tinyurl.com/2s4abc2x, where 2s4abc2x is 8 chars path that is randomly created for each link
- The array of shortened URLs is stored in the local storage so that the user can view previously shortened URLs
- The user can delete the shortened link from the array in local storage
- The user can copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- The user receives an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The provided input is not a link

### Further Application Development Plans

- Cypress Tests
- Building a server and adding a database
