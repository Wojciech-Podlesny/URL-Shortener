# URL Shortener

## Project overview

The URL Shortener app allows users to easily shorten any valid URL, store and manage a list of shortened links, and copy them to their clipboard with a single click. The application ensures an optimal layout across different screen sizes and provides error handling for invalid input.

## Features

- The user can view the optimal layout for the page for most used widths (more details below)
- The user can shorten any valid URL to https://tinyurl.com/2s4abc2x, where 2s4abc2x is 8 chars path that is randomly created for each link
- The array of shortened URLs is stored in the local storage so that the user can view previously shortened URLs
- The user can delete the shortened link from the array in local storage
- The user can copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- The user receives an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The provided input is not a link
